 Attached is a csv file with 4 columns of data. The first column is an id column, and the remaining 3 are data columns.

 Please write an iOS app that:

     Processes the dataset and calculates mean and std deviation for each data column. Please optimize for performance and memory usage.
     Determines which samples for each column is more than 2 std deviations.
     Displays in UIKit or SwiftUI the mean and std deviation for each column. Display the column result immediately before processing the next column.
     Also displays the number of samples in each column are more than 2 std deviations.


 The spirit of this assignment is to spark a conversation with you about how you approached the assignment, and what choices you made.
